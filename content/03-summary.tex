\section{Summary and outlook}

In this contribution, the implementation of the photoelectric effect, photonuclear interactions, muon pair production, and the LPM effect for pair production as well as their effect on the total cross section of photons have been presented.
For photon energies below $\approx \SI{20}{\mega\electronvolt}$, the implementation has been verified by comparison with independent calculations. 
With these updates, PROPOSAL is now able to provide a complete description of electron, positron, and photon processes in the energy range important for the simulation of electromagnetic cascades.
The current main application for these improvements is the air shower simulation framework CORSIKA~8, where the current status is presented in \cite{icrc2023}.
However, the modular structure allows its usage for many other applications as well.
In the future, the simulation of neutrino interactions with PROPOSAL using only-stochastic propagation is planned to be implemented.
